                Broad description
            </p1>
            <p>
                While using spotify most of us search for a song we know and listen to and then either choose a playlist with what is already know or we let the algorithm take the reigns and play songs for us based on our known preferences.
                The intent of the project is to provide the user with song suggestions for a particular genre that have not been generated based on their preferences, thus broadening their musical horizon. When a user selects a genre and presses the button, we show a list of 9 randomly selected songs along with the links to them on Spotify, a galery of their album covers and a chart of their length. Once a user has picked a song they can click on the link which will tak them to spotify web page where they can listen to it.
